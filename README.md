## About

We all have these good moments in Berlin, on these places that we have made ours because they really suite our personality or resonates with the mood we are. Berlin is such a kaleidoscope of discoveries.

If you can imagine in detail your perfect weekend in Berlin, how it would be? Where will you go for breakfast and just after that?

I am working on this personal small web project:

On it you can see the city through the eyes of another berliner. Wake up with them and go across the day and night visiting their favourite places the whole way over their perfect weekend.

For example, this is one of mines:

I want to work more on this project and make it really attractive and usable for everybody so if you have any feedback, comment or suggestion don't hesitate to share it with me.

... and of course if you want to write your own perfect Berlin weekend find the link on the footer of the page ;)

(If you are finding references to a discontinued section from the Ex-berliner magazine, you are right, I was very hook to this section where semi-famous berliners were talking about their perfect weekend in Berlin, I always wanted to open this to everybody)


### Update

Thanks a lot for all the styling feedback, definitely I have to work on that, I am usually very brutalist in my designs but I have not any design background so I usually screw up things. Before I was investing some money on profesional design help I wanted to know if there is any positive acceptation of the concept.
